# -Practika_B7
I wanted to, like last time, through "pygame". The module ended 2 weeks ago, all this time I was writing code in the evenings, at first everything was fine. Then something went wrong, it throws an error until I was able to figure out where I missed something. Since I was afraid of not being in time, I completed the task according to the algorithm from the module.
А еще мой английски пока хромает и это плохо.
